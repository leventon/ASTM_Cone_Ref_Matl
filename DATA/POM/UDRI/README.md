####Original, more manual approach:
**TEMPLATE FILE, for temporary reference only; copied from MaCFP 2021 submission**

####Newer Approach
**Our new cone database uses test-metadata.json files to hold all relevant info for each test. Because this can be parsed, we can then do analysis on each of these input quantities (e.g., holder/frame/grid, orientation, backing insulation..) and derived test output quantities (e.g., species yields, ignition times, heats of combustion).  

Rather than ask users to create summary files here, we could share our parsing scripts that create these .json files based on the cone output data/generated report files.**

### Experimental Conditions, Cone calorimeter
* Extraction flow rate: 24L/s
* Sample Surface Area: 0.01
* Sample holder dimensions:
    - Square pan: 106mm x 106mm x 25mm
    - Retainer frame: no
    - Retaining grid: no
* Backing Insulation: Ceramic wool thermal conductivity (measured via guarded hot plate:  0.04 W/m-K at  30 C) 
* Sample back side temperature was not measured. 
* Note - Aluminum foil damaged in many tests, so mass losses appear to be more than 100% as some of the aluminum foil was oxidized/lost during testing
